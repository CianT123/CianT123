# Background
Hi and welcome to my page!

My name is Cian and I am from Cork in Ireland.
I'm a pretty standard Irish twenty-something year-old, with a passion for Sports, Nature and Guiness 

Growing up, I always loved building things and solving problems. 

Until we were 12, my brother and I had a minuture farm set up in the attic. 
Even then, I was contantly thinking about the best way to set up a system. 
Somethings size, location and proximity to other resources were all being considered.
I really loved to put myself in a situation where I could solve real problems, especially with simple but unintuitive solutions. 

The better you are at something, the more you will probably like it, and the more you like something, the more you will thrive at it. 
This was my experience with Maths. 
I showed an aptitude early on, regularly achieving the highest grades in my class. 

To build on my strengths, I chose to enroll in the Mathematics degree in University College Cork
